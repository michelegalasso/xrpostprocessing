# Introduction 
This is a collection of scripts for postprocessing USPEX results when working with X-ray data.
The instructions for using each script are in the file `documentation/documentation.pdf`.

# First use
I suppose that you have Python 3 installed in your system, and that it is accessible through the command `python`.
1.  Unzip the project folder
2.  `python -m venv .venv`
3.  `.venv\Scripts\activate` or for Linux just use `source .venv/bin/activate`
4.  `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Add permanently the project folder to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable

# Before every use
1.  Go to the project folder
2.  `.venv\Scripts\activate` or for Linux just use `source .venv/bin/activate`
